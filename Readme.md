# Meow

is a modification of the original kattis submission client:

Currently we can do stuff like this

```
meow new <problem> [-t TEMPLATE]
meow submit [-h] [-p PROBLEM] [-m MAINCLASS] [-l LANGUAGE] [-t TAG] <files ...>
```



<!--

kattis list
kattis status
kattis browser
kattis random <difficulty>
kattis queue <problem>
kattis poll

<difficulty> := trivial | easy | medium | hard
<problem> := kattis problem shortname

-->
